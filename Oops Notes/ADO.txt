A Collection of Inter-Related Data is called as Database.

Databases are divided into 3 types.

DBMS		RDBMS		ORDBMS

DBASE		ORACLE		ORACLE 8i....
FOXBASE		SQLSERVER	SQLSERVER2005
FOXPRO		MS-ACCESS	
EXCEL		DB/2



ADO.NET

1) ADO.NET is an object library for communicating with Databases.

2) ADO.NET introduced an assembly called as System.Data.Dll

3) ADO.Net supports two types of connections.


D


a- Managed Connection
b- Unmanaged Connection


4) UnManaged connection works with the help of OLEDB (Object linking and Embedding
 Data Bases) Providers.

5) OLEDB Providers are predeveloped Dll files, these Dlls are platform Dependents.

6) Hence Conn. over OLEDB are called as UnManaged connections.

7) Managed Conn. works over TDS(Tabllar Data Stream) protocol.

8) Managed Conn. are faster.

9) ADO.Net used to develop client-Server Archietectures.

10) ADO.net Namespaces are divided into 5 groups.

g1) Common Namespaces
1- system.data
2- system.data.common
3- system.data.SqlTypes

g2) UnManaged Namespaces
4- system.data.OleDb (All Databases)

g3) Managed Namespaces
5- system.data.SqlClient (SqlServer only)
6- system.data.OracleClient (Oracle)

g4) ODBC Namespaces
7- system.data.ODBC (All Databases)

g5) LINQ related Namespaces
8- system.data.LINQ




Note :
* If Sql Connection class is used to connect SqlServer or Oracle Connection class is
 used to connect Oracle DB then provider = provider name should not be mention with
 in the connection string.







Data Adapter :
 Data Adapter is used to carry the Data between object and DataBase.

syntax:
xxxDataAdapter da=new xxxDataAdapterr(Query,ConnectionString|Conn. Object);


Note:

If the dataAdapter is define based on above syntax then it generates select
 command only and other command objects of Data Adapter will not be generated.







Data Set:

1) Data set is a class which is the part of System.Data NameSpace.
2) Data set supports connection-less Architecture. Active connection is not required.
3) Data set cannot communicates directly with DB or viceversa.
4) Data adapter is a class, which is used to provide the communication in between Dataset and Database.
5) DataAdapter is used to carry the data only but not to hold the data.
6) Data set holds a collection of tables, where CLR gives an index number automatically optionally.
7) Data set supports to create relations.
8) Data set works with the help of XML Technology.



D


syntax:
DataSet ds=new DataSet();




DataSet Class hirarchy :
 A collection of classes which are related to DataSet is called as DataSet
 class hirarchy.


	
		DataSet



	Relations		Tables



	Data Relation		Data Table
					- Rows -Data Row
					- Columns -Data Col.
					- Primary Key -Data Col.
					- Data View











Steps to work with Connection Oriented Model :

- Define a connection Object
	- Connection

- Define a command Object
	- Command Conn. =
	- Command Type = <Text|Table Direct|Stored Procedure>
	- Command Text = "______"
	- [Parameter Def.]

- Open the Connection


Statement :

	Select			Any Valid stmt. other then Select
	
	ExecuteScalar()		ExecuteNonQuery()
	ExecuteReader()


- Close the Connection




1) ExecuteNonQuery() :
 Required while executing DDL,DML and SP. It returns "Integer value ".



2) ExecuteReader() :

 Required to execute Select stmt. need to be called when multiple
 records are expected from a Select stmt. It returns "DataReader ".


3) ExecuteScalar() :
 Required to execute Select stmt. ExecuteScalar() looks for first
 match only, If match is found then only first column value of that
 Row will be returned as an Object DataType.








Steps to work with Disconnected Model:

- Steps to Retrieve Data :
	* Define a connection object
	* Define a DataAdapter object
	* Define a DataSet object
	* Fill the DataSet
	* Assign the DataSet and bind the Data or return the 
DataSet object



- Steps to insert the record :
	* Define a DataRow variable
	syntax:
		
	* Assign the NewRow of the Data Member of DataSet to the DataRow Variable.
	syntax:
	
	* Assign the values for the DataCols. of the Data member of DataSet
	syntax:
	
	* Add the DataRow variable to the DataRows collection of the data member of 
	data set.
	
		
	* Update the DataAdapter with the Data present at the Data member of 			DataSet
	syntax:
	





- Steps to update the Data:
	* Define a Data Row variable
	* Assign the dataRow which has to be modified to the dataRow variable
	
		
	* Start the Edit Mode

		
	* Assign the values to the Data Cols. of the DataRow variable

	* End the Edit Mode
	
		
	* Update the DataAdapter with the data present at the data member of DataSet




- Steps to delete the Data:
	* Delete the DataRow from the DataRows Collection of the data members of DataSet

	* Update the DataAdapter with the Data present in data member of dataSet
