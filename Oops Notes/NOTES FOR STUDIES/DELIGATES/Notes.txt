User Defined Controls :

> When predefined controls are not supporting user's requirement
 then User defined control need to be developed.
> UDC contains the app. logic along with GUI.
> UDC are Re-usable.
> The UDC developed in c#.net can be used in vb.net also and
 vice-versa.
> C#.Net or vb.net UDC does not works in ASP.Net.
> To develop UDC, .Net introduced windows forms control library
 template.
> UDC are form dependents.
> UDC will be created in DLL format.
> UDC is a class, which must be inherited from a predefined class
 called as usercontrol or any existing control also.

	a> General UC
	b> Inherited UC

a> General UC :
> Design & Logic

b> Inherited UC :
> Only Logic
> INH user control is a concept of extending the functionality of an 
existing control.
> In inherited user controls, all the properties of the base control
will be derived.
> INH User control contains only logic but not design.







User Defined Properties :

> A collection of set and get methods is called as a property.
> A property which contains only get is called as read only property.


















User Defined Events :

> When part of user controls logic and part of Form's logic need to
 be executed at one shot then user defined events are required.
> User Defined Event is also called as call back procedures.









Delegates :

> Delegates are similar to C++ function pointers.
> Delegates are used to encapsulate some info. like class names
 and method names.
> Delegates holds the address of one or many Functions.
> Based on above stmt. , delegates are divided into two types.

	SCD		MCD

> SCD holds the address of only one function.
> MCD holds the addresses of Many functions.
> MCD holds a sequence of Methods.

( in C#.Net only)
> MCD supports airthmatic + and - operations.
> + operator adds a method into the sequence.
> - operator removes a method from the sequence.
