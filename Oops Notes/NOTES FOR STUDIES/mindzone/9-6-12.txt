> Platform Independent :

obs 1 : as .class file is executable in any OS with the help of 
JVM( Java Virtual Machine ), hence Java is called as platform
independent.

JVM Software is platform dependent.
a seperate version of JVM software is introduced for every OS.



obs 2 : as .exe (executable) or .DLL (Dynamic Link Library) are 
executable in any OS with the help of a CLR (Common Language Runtime).

hence .Net is platform independent.
for every OS a seperate version of CLR is available, hence CLR is
Platform dependent.

********* is .Net is Pure Platform Independent or not ?

.Net is partially Platform Independent Languages.
as of now CLR softwares are not yet developed for DOS and Win 95


















> Language Independent :

as .Net application logic can be developed in any .net framework
 compatiable languages,hence .Net is called as Language Independent.

as of now .net framework is supporting.


12 languages + 1 specification ( ASP.Net )

1) Visual C#.Net
2) Visual Basic.Net
3) Visual J#.Net
4) Visual C++.Net
5) COBOL.Net
6) PERL.Net
7) VBScript.Net
8) JScript.Net
9) PHP.Net
10) Small Talk.Net
11) Python.Net
12) Visual F#.Net


VB.Net is not case sensitive
C#.Net is case sensitive
ASP.Net is depend on Language


ASP.Net is a specification, which provides a set of rules and
 these rules need to be followed by Integrated Language.













What is DLL?
as per VB6.0 or VC++6.0

DLL = Reusable = COM = OS dependent = Platform dependent


1) as per VB6.0 or VC++6.0, DLLs are called as COM Components.
2) COM is used to developed Reusable Components.
3) COM Components must be registered for a class id.
4) Class ID is part of Registry.
5) as Registry is u/c of Windows OS, hence COM is Platform dependent.

What is DLL as per .Net?

1) as per .Net, A DLL contains platform independent code in the format
 of Byte Code.
2) A DLL is also called as Assembly.
3) A DLL is also called as Managed Code.
4) A DLL is also called as MSIL(Microsoft intermediate Language).











What is managed code?

> The Code, which targets CLR is called as Managed Code.
> The Code, which takes OS help while execution is called as 
UNManaged Code.
> Managed Code is faster in Execution.


.Net framework is intoduced as a development platform.

as Memory Management is u/c of .Net framework with the help of Garbage Collector ( GC ).hence .Net framework is called as development.














.Net framework is devided into Two Parts
  
1) FCL ( Framework Class Library )

#include<stdio.h> = Header file = Collection of Methods
main()
{
	printf("hello");
}


> FCL is a collection of predefined classes, which are distributed
 as Assembilies.
> A collection of classes is called as a Namespace.
> A Collection of Namespaces is called as an Assembly.
> A collection of Assembilies is called as FCL.

FCL Contains :
> ~6000 predefined classes.
> ~65000 predefined methods.
> ~1,00,000 predefined properties.












2) What is CLR ?

CLR is a standard runtime execution engine for Managed Code.

when .net is installed, then CLR related files will be stored in
C:\Windows\System32  folder

> The most important file in CLR software is MSCoreE.DLL (Microsoft
 Core Execution Library)
