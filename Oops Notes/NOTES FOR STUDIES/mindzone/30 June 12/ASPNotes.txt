Internet Technology :


		HTTP Request
Client			->	Web Server	+ (FF+DB+N/W)
			<-			External Resources
		HTTP Response
	(Connection Oriented Stateless protocol)







Obs:

Whenever a client sends a request for the contents present with in 
the Web Server. the Server can provide the response but if a request
 is given for any external resources then the Web Server can't handle
 the request alone.



Requirement:

A technology to content the external resources and to provide the 
response to the Clients.

Solution:

Server Side Technology



> CGI (Common Gateway Interface) Technology:










Advantage:

> Performance will be faster


Limitation:

> Resources of the Web Server will not be efficiently used and hence 
it provides the burden to the Web Server(CGI Engine).



Requirement:

A technology to content the external resources and to provide the 
response to the clients without my burden to the Web Server
 (CGI Engine).



Solution:

Servlets



D



Advantage:

Web Server resources will be used very effciently.


Limitation:

Performance will be very Slow.



Requirement:

A technology to contact external resources and has to provide the 
response to the clients with out providing any burdon to the Web 
Server and to Clients.






Solution:

Server Pages Technology

Sun Microsystems	-	Java Server Pages 				(JSP)
Oracle Corp.		-	PL/SQL Server Pages 				(PSP)
Microsoft Corp.		-	Active Server Pages 				(ASP)





ASP 3.0 Archietecture









Whenever a client sends a request for the ASP page then the Script 
engine (asp.dll) accepts the request and interacts with the external
 resources based on the ASP page instructions and creates a Server page 
dynamically which will be provided as the response to the client. 
Once the response is provided the server page created at the 
Web Server will be removed implictly.


Note :
The same process will take place for any no. of further clients request.











ASP.Net Arch. :

For 1'st time client request>




















For 2nd or Nth time client request>


























Note :
> Whenever the client sends a request for the ASPx Page for first 
time then the page is identified and the page will be Compiled and 
the result of the compiled page will be provided as the response to
 the clients from the Server.






> If the client sends a request for 2nd or Nth time and if source 
code is not modified then the server reads the Compiled itself and 
its result will be provided as the response to the clients.












ASP 3.0 Prog. Model :



To collect the Data >
* GET : Request.QueryString("name")
* POST : Request.Form("name")





















ASP.Net prog. Model :



















To collect the Data :
	ControlName.PropertyName



Auto Post Back :
 Submitting the data to the Same page is called as AutoPostBack.




Page.isPostBack :
 Returns false if the page is requested for the first time and returns 
true if the data has been Submitted to the Server.






Drawbacks of ASP 3.0 :


ASP=HTML (UI)
 +
JavaScript (client side validations with the help of Compiler)
 +
VBScript (Server side code with the help of Interpreter)
 +
COM (External Resources)
 +
ASP Builting Objects
 -Request
 -Response
 -Server
 -Session
 -Application



> No order to provide for writing the code.
> Huge complex coding is needed.
> It is not WYSWYG.
> No In-built Security.
> No proper State Management.
> Caching is not efficient.
> Performance.
> All the drawbacks of COM is applicable.
> Setup and Deployment.


To overcome the drawbacks Microsoft has introduced ASP.Net











ASP.Net :
 It is a specification for developing Websites, Web Services and 
Mobile Application.


Note :
Since ASP.Net is a specification it should be implemented with the 
support of any language that targets the .Net


ex:> VB.Net, Visual C#.Net
